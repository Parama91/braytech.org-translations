Notably, replicating the experiences of the game's _Triumphs_ and _Collections_ views.\n\nToday, Braytech does a lot more than just triumph records and checklists. Building all these interfaces was the first step—subsequent steps include connecting them to one another and realising the relationships between their data e.g. how quests connect to specific locations in the game world.\n\nNeed to find something quick? Press  and start typing! Braytech has a search HUD, available anywhere in the app.\n\nBraytech is built for desktop users first, but works and looks beautiful as a mobile app. In fact, there's an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braytech.org.twa) in the Play store.",

So, shout outs to the crew at [Destiny Item Manager](https://destinyitemmanager.com/), [Richard Deveraux](https://lowlidev.com.au/), and all the others who've kept Tom sane while he tries to do the silly things he does.",
